blackjack!


--> planning to make it a 'proper' game w/ libgdx... 

here's my planning for that, I guess:

card objects would also have positions on the screen, for displaying that card, you would display the value in the corner relative to the position etc.
so you'd only need imgs of suits and values (rather than 52-54 imgs)
